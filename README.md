# Terribly inaccessible Todo list!

This application is an example of how terribly accessible your website _can_ be.

## Setup
For those with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or a compatible node version installed, simply start the application by running the following commands:
```sh
nvm use
npm install
npm run dev
```
The website should now be available on [localhost](http://localhost:5173/).

## Structure
The main component structure is as follows:
```
App
|- Logo
|- ItemList
|  |- Item[]
|- AddItemForm
```
